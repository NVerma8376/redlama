Today we're talking about learning
Python efficiently. Not the endless
tutorial cycle that keeps you stuck, but
an actual strategy that works. Now look,
tutorials are great, but we all know
about tutorial hell. And even though
that's a majority of what I provide on
this channel, I don't want to see you
get stuck there. Now, first, let's
quickly cover why Python is worth your
time, and then we'll get into the
strategy for learning it. Now, first,
it's versatile. From web development to
AI, data science or automation, Python
works for a variety of tasks. Number two
is that it consistently ranks in the top
three programming languages for job
demand. Number three, the salary is
quite high. The average Python developer
salary is around 100k in the United
States. And number four is that it's
perfect for both professional work and
personal projects or hobbyists. Now,
Python is great, but here's the problem.
Most people learn Python watching video
after video without making real
progress. So, I want to break down how
you can fix that. Now, overall, my main
advice is to spend 20% of your time
consuming and 80% of your time actually
writing code. That's it. That's the
secret. It's simple, but it's not easy.
Note that distinction there. Simple, but
not easy. Now, here's the exact process
that I would follow if I was starting
over to learn Python efficiently. Now,
step number one is to master the basics
quickly. This should take you one to two
weeks maximum. Now, especially in the
world of AI, mastering the basics can be
done pretty quickly. Now, I'm not
talking about every single built-in
function here, but just enough for you
to be able to solve some basic problems.
So, pick one resource, yes, just one to
learn the basics. Variables, data types,
loops, functions, basic object-oriented
programming. That's it. Don't spend
months here. just get enough knowledge
to start building something and then the
rest you're going to learn on the fly.
Now, personally, I'd recommend that you
pick either a short course that focuses
on practical examples that can be from
YouTube like videos from my channel or
even a paid program, something like a
Udemy course, or you look at something
like Python's official documentation.
Now, of course, everyone learns
differently and there's so many options,
but I find when you're just starting out
that videos are super useful because you
really do need things broken down more
slowly and you can learn a lot when
you're listening to someone who's
experienced rather than reading through
something like a book, for example,
where you might miss the emphasis or
some of the important points. Now, while
you learn this syntax, make sure that
you're doing this by giving yourself
mini challenges alongside the tutorials
that you're following. Try to predict
what code will do before you run it.
Guess what the instructor is going to do
next. Code alongside and mess with the
code. Try to break it. The more
interactive, the more you're going to
learn. And this leads me to step number
two, which is interactive learning. Now,
you need to spend a few weeks here
learning and developing your skills in
an interactive way. Most important point
here, again, 20% watching and 80% doing.
In fact, research shows that when you
just passively watch tutorials or read
articles, you only retain about 20% of
the information. But with active
learning, when you're actually coding
and building projects as you learn, you
can retain 75 to 90% of what you study.
And personally, I found that true for
myself. Now, honestly, that's why I
recommend Data Camp when you first start
with Python because the platform is
super interactive and it lets you code
right inside of their environment,
getting instant feedback as you go. Now,
Data Camp is sponsoring this video and
I'm excited to tell you about their two
Python learning tracks because they're
genuinely something I wish I had when I
was getting started many years ago. Now,
I've used Data Camp myself and I've been
recommending it for a while, many videos
on this channel. And if you're just
getting started, I'd highly recommend
the Python programming fundamentals
track, which is designed to teach you
the basics from variables, functions,
and all the way up to working with data,
which is exactly what I said before. And
if you're looking to push things to the
next level and get job ready as a Python
developer, they also have the associate
Python developer track, which dives
deeper into real world skills like
working with APIs, data structures, and
debugging. Now, both tracks are
hands-on, project-driven, and designed
to actually help you practice, not just
passively, but interactively learning.
And right now, Data Camp is offering 25%
off using my link in the description.
So, if you're serious about learning
Python the right way, don't miss out.
Now, once you've mastered the syntax and
you have some confidence, the next step
is to pick a niche. Honestly, this is
where most people fail. they keep
watching general Python videos instead
of diving deeper into a specific area.
Now, you need to choose one area to
focus on and I'm going to give you a few
examples here. So, first could be web
development with something like Django,
Flask or Fast API. Next, you could do
game development with something like
Pygame. Then you have data analysis with
something like Pandas or NumPy. You
could do machine learning with
TensorFlow or PyTorch. You could work
with AI agents using something like
Langchain or Langraph. or you could
build automation scripts for your daily
tasks. Lastly, you could even do
hardware projects with something like
Raspberry Pi. Then once you've picked a
niche, you need to complete a project in
that area. When you get stuck, look up
solutions to specific problems, not just
general Python tutorials. For example,
if you're making a Django site and you
can't figure out the authentication,
search for that specific issue rather
than watching a three-hour Django
tutorial video. This is honestly where
you're going to learn the most and where
I personally saw most of my success when
I was getting into programming. You pick
a niche, you get really excited about a
specific project, something you actually
want to work on, and then you learn all
of the skills that you need to get that
project to completion. So, please pick a
niche, pick a project you want to work
on, and actually finish it. Doing this
forces you to learn so much more than
simply following along with tutorials.
And while those tutorials can help you,
most of the learning happens when you're
struggling, failing, and constantly
having to look up solutions on your own.
Now, personally, I actually started
learning Python by working with Pygame,
a 2D graphics library. And you can see
many examples on this channel,
especially many years ago when I was
doing Pygame tutorials. But honestly,
you can pick anything that interests
you. The most important thing is just to
make sure that you stick with it. Okay.
So, at this point, you've learned the
syntax, you've practiced interactively,
you've dove into a niche, and now it's
time to become Pythonic. That's step
number four. Now, here's the time to
level up and learn what makes Python
code elegant, and efficient. This is
where you're going to transition from
writing code that just works to writing
code that's clean, efficient, and
distinctly Python. Now, let's talk about
some specific Python features that
separate beginners from intermediates
that you're definitely going to want to
learn, especially if you really want to
get into Python. Now the first is list
comprehensions. So instead of writing
this, you can write this. It's not just
shorter, it's actually faster and more
memory efficient in many cases and it's
very popular in Python code. Next we
have generator expressions. When dealing
with large data sets, this is crucial
and it can save you a lot of time and a
lot of memory. Next, context managers.
The width statement can handle resource
cleanup automatically and it's something
important to understand. Then we have
dictionary and set operations. These are
extremely valuable to learn and I find
they're heavily underused in Python code
considering what they can do. Next, we
have decorators. These let you modify
functions without changing their code
and they show up in a ton of Python
frameworks. Then we have things like
typins for larger projects. These are
super important and they can make your
code a lot more maintainable. The key
point here is that Python has a ton of
unique features that the reasons people
love or hate using the language. So
spend some time, dive into these, and
learn about the more advanced and
pythonic features. I obviously didn't
cover all of them in this video. I'm
just giving you a few examples so you
get an idea of what I mean. All right,
so now let's move on to step number
five, which is to keep building and keep
shipping. Now, this is where most
programmers plateau. They learn the
basics, but they never develop the habit
of finishing projects. Typically, the
developers who progress the fastest are
those who constantly ship and actually
complete their work. Now, let me break
down what I mean by shipping. This means
using version control properly. Create a
GitHub account if you don't already have
one. Learn the basics of Git. Understand
how to commit, push, pull, set up
branches, write meaningful commit
messages, structure your repositories
professionally, and then go ahead and
deploy your applications. For web apps,
learn to use something like Heroku,
Railway, or Render. For data projects,
you can create sharable notebooks on
Google Collab or something like Kaggle.
For utilities, you can package them
properly with setup tools. And for web
services, you can learn Docker and
containerize them. Honestly, there's all
kinds of way to deploy your
applications. It's obviously hard to
cover all of that in this video, but the
point is you actually want to push this
out into the wild and most importantly
finish the project. I know so many
developers that have hundreds of
half-finish projects. Honestly, that
happened to me a lot when I was starting
out. You don't want to be one of those.
And that's because the habit of
finishing projects compounds over time.
Each completed project builds your
practical problem-solving skills,
increases your confidence, adds to your
portfolio, and most importantly teaches
you how to work through the boring parts
of coding, which is what most developers
do every single day. Now, one
professionallook, fully completed
project is worth a lot more than a dozen
half-finish tutorials. And the best
developers that I know all share this
trait. They finish what they start. Now,
remember, your goal here isn't to be
good at Python tutorials. It's to be
good at building things with Python.
That's the point of coding. Now, here
are my final thoughts for this video. If
you're 6 months into learning Python and
you haven't built anything substantial
yet, then you're doing it wrong. The
pattern is simple. Learn a little bit,
build something, get stuck, learn what
you need to learn to fix that, and
repeat. That's how the real skills are
built. Now, if you found this helpful,
hit the subscribe button, like this
video, and let me know what you think in
the comments down below. I want to hear
